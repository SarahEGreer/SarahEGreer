### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sarah, I am a fullstack software engineer, currently studying with Tech Elevator! 

I am passionate about clean code and responsive, accessible design. 

When I'm not coding, you can find me learning new (non-programming) languages, hiking with my dog, and working on a variety of DIY projects.
